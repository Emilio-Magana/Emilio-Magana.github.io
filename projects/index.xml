      <description>For Junior Design my teammates and I were assigned to build and program a SCARA Robot Arm that would be controlled
      with an Arduino using a Jetson Nano for computer vision, along with a custom made PCB. The SCARA Robot Arm would have the functionality to draw a 10-inch
      straight line within 2.5 seconds (with a margin of error within Â±0.25 inches) and be able to sort a single layer of US coins into their proper slots of the
      enclosure. My Teammates were: Liam Duncan, Stephen More, and Mazen Elsheikh.</description>
