      <description>For Junior Design my teammates and I were assigned to build and program a SCARA Robot Arm that would be controlled with an Arduino using a Jetson Nano for
      computer vision, along with a custom made PCB. The SCARA Robot Arm would have the functionality to draw a 10-inch straight line within 2.5 seconds (with a margin of
      error within ±0.25 inches) and be able to sort a single layer of US coins into their proper slots of the enclosure.
      My Teammates were: Liam Duncan, Stephen More, and Mazen Elsheikh.</description>

      <description>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science at Oregon State University in Electrical and Computer Engineering and plan to finish in June 2021.
      I’m taking a wide variety of classes, with my interests laying mainly with Integrated Circuits, VLSI, Digital Logic Design, and Power Electronics.
      As of now I’m in search for an entry level job and possible internship this coming summer for when I graduate from Oregon State in June 2021.
      Hoping to gain experience and contribute in fields that I specialize within.
      In my free time one can often find me riding my bike around town, at the Climbing Gyms on Campus, either on rope or bouldering, working on a side project, or at a local house show :-).
